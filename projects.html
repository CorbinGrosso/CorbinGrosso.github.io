            <i>(February 2020 - May 2021)</i> I was part of a small research group at The College of New Jersey researching machine learning algorithms and their effectiveness working with natural language processing. All work for this was using Python, and my experience mainly centered around input processing.

            <i>(June 2021 - present)</i> Through the tutoring company I worked for, I did 1-on-1 tutoring with fellow college students, helping them learn Python. I also lead small group classes teaching Python to teenagers and adults and JavaScript for elementary schoolers. In the Python classes, I focused on teaching a mix of data processing and creating games and simple applications, and in the JavaScript classes, I focused entirely on being able to make interactive projects, such as games.

        <i>(January 2023 - May 2023)</i> For my Capstone project, I created a mobile game for Android called Tile Flip. While working on it, I learned how to manage activities, create graphics, make simple animations, and more. If this sounds interesting, you can check out Tile Flip on my <a href="https://github.com/CorbinGrosso/TileFlip" id="githubLink">GitHub</a>!

        I have a strong understanding and a lot of comfort with Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I have a basic understanding of C/C++, but a lot more practice with those languages would be needed before I call myself proficient.
