      <td class="data">
      I have an endless passion for creating. Learning to do something is an incredibly fun experience for me because it's a way to push myself beyond my current limitations, and using that newly-gained knowledge to make something new excites me every single time.
      <br>
      What I lack in experience, I make up for with a passion for learning and achieving. I love proving myself to my peers and superiors, but I also know that I can't do that if I don't ask for help when I need it. I give everything my all, but when that's not enough, I won't hesitate to ask for help. Nobody learns everything on their own, after all.

<tr>
    <td class="title">Dream Job</td>
    <td class="data">
    My dream job has me creating something. I don't need to be a lead team member to like the job; being part of the team making something that people will enjoy is enough make me happy.
    <br>
    I'm still on the search for the exact job of my dreams. For now, I know it be something like video game programming, software engineering, or maybe even programming a robot or machine of some kind!
